 **Hey Everyone I was wishing to make a discord channel so that we all can have a backup server where we all can be there apart from the temporary groups on whatsapp.** 

 *These are the 3 main problem that Discord solves over whatsapp**
 
 **1) User Restriction:**
 => There's a User Restriction of group members on whatsapp group whereas in Discord there's no user limit that means all your friends can join the server. The bigger the group the more chances of getting resources, help, and so on...
 
 **2) Information Segregation:**
 => Information can't be segregated and its more likely to miss the information between the chats. On the other hand in Discord there's a dedicated server which is made for each and everything from Placement links, projects, subjects to everything. which means now anyone wont miss out anything on a particular topic.
 
 **3) Shifting between Temporary Groups:**
 => Shifting between groups during the exams and making of multiple groups on whatsapp due to for maintaining safety, sometimes results into you being left out from the group if you see the message late and you miss out the information then. so even if you're left behind then too you'll have a place where you can communicate with the community on the server and its more likely that you'll be back in there. 
 
 
 **Things we will do in the Discord**
 
 => We can make temporary groups while exams for helping each other while exams and delete them when the exam is over.
 
 => We can do preparation for exams, placement, etc together and as there will be many server so no-one will be disturbed.
 
 => We can share our projects and help each other in project so that our doubts will be cleared and workload and tension will reduce.
 
 => All the doubts can be solved as there will be more people to help.
 
 => We can make open source projects together. You'll are already aware of power of opensource.
 
 => As the community is open for all so we can have all our friends together so that no-one will be bored or feel alone in the community.
 
 => Benefits of being in a developer community can be endless.
 
 **But all this isn't possible without you'll. Its just a idea which we all can make it true with a little contribution and we all will enjoy the benifits in a long run.**
 
 
 If you find these things interesting you can join the server from the link below..
